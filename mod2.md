# Module 2: Teaching MongoDB

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the key features and benefits of MongoDB as a NoSQL database
- Learn how to design data models for MongoDB, including collections, documents, and normalization/denormalization
- Perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using MongoDB
- Query documents using MongoDB's query operators and aggregation framework
- Implement indexing for improved query performance
- Use Mongoose to connect applications to MongoDB, define schemas, and perform validations

## Skill-Based Assessment

### Assignment: Create a MongoDB Database for a Blog

**Objective:** Demonstrate your understanding of MongoDB, data modeling, CRUD operations, querying documents, indexing, and Mongoose.

**Instructions:**

1. Design a data model for a blog that includes collections for users, posts, and comments.
2. Set up a MongoDB database locally or using a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas.
3. Use Mongoose to define schemas for the users, posts, and comments collections, ensuring that appropriate validation is applied.
4. Implement CRUD operations for users, posts, and comments using Mongoose.
5. Create sample queries to demonstrate various query operators and the aggregation framework.
6. Implement indexing for appropriate fields in your collections.
7. Write a brief report (1-2 pages) outlining your approach to designing the data model, implementing CRUD operations, querying documents, indexing, and using Mongoose.

### Submission

- Commit your source code, Mongoose schemas, sample queries, and the brief report (as a PDF or Markdown file) to a GitHub repository.
- Submit the GitHub repository link via Canvas.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

1. Proper data model design for the blog
2. Correct use of Mongoose for schema definition, validation, and CRUD operations
3. Variety and correctness of sample queries
4. Appropriate indexing of fields in collections
5. Clarity and organization of the report

*Note: Remember to provide clear instructions in your repository's README file on how to set up your application, and provide seed data*
