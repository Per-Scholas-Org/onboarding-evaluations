# Module 1: Introduction to Teaching the MERN Stack and Software Engineering

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the components of the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)
- Recognize the advantages of using the MERN Stack for web application development
- Learn about various software engineering principles and their importance in application development
- Gain insight into different software development methodologies
- Differentiate between front-end and back-end development
- Compare the Model-View-Controller (MVC) and Model-View-Presenter (MVP) design patterns

## Skill-Based Assessment

### Assignment: Create a Simple MERN Stack Application

**Objective:** Demonstrate your understanding of the MERN Stack components, software engineering principles, and basic front-end and back-end development concepts.

**Instructions:**

1. Set up a new MERN Stack project with MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js.
2. Create a simple application that allows users to add, view, and delete items from a to-do list.
3. Apply software engineering principles to ensure your code is maintainable, reusable, testable, flexible, and efficient.
4. Implement front-end features using React.js, and handle back-end logic with Express.js and Node.js.
5. Connect your application to a MongoDB database to store and retrieve the to-do list data.
6. Write a brief report (1-2 pages) outlining your approach to the application development, the software engineering principles applied, and any challenges you faced during the process.

### Submission

- Commit your source code and the brief report (as a PDF or Markdown file) to a GitHub repository.
- Submit the GitHub repository link via Canvas.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

1. Proper implementation of the MERN Stack components
2. Application of software engineering principles
3. Functionality of the to-do list application
4. Clarity and organization of the report

*Note: Remember to provide clear instructions in your repository's README file on how to set up and run your application locally.*
