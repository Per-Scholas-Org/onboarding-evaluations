# Module 1: Introduction to Teaching the MERN Stack and Software Engineering

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the components of the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)
- Recognize the advantages of using the MERN Stack for web application development
- Learn about various software engineering principles and their importance in application development
- Gain insight into different software development methodologies
- Differentiate between front-end and back-end development
- Compare the Model-View-Controller (MVC) and Model-View-Presenter (MVP) design patterns

## Skill-Based Assessment

### Assignment: Create a Simple MERN Stack Application

**Objective:** Demonstrate your understanding of the MERN Stack components, software engineering principles, and basic front-end and back-end development concepts.

**Instructions:**

1. Set up a new MERN Stack project with MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js.
2. Create a simple application that allows users to add, view, and delete items from a to-do list.
3. Apply software engineering principles to ensure your code is maintainable, reusable, testable, flexible, and efficient.
4. Implement front-end features using React.js, and handle back-end logic with Express.js and Node.js.
5. Connect your application to a MongoDB database to store and retrieve the to-do list data.
6. Write a brief report (1-2 pages) outlining your approach to the application development, the software engineering principles applied, and any challenges you faced during the process.

### Submission

- Commit your source code and the brief report (as a PDF or Markdown file) to a GitHub repository.
- Submit the GitHub repository link via Canvas.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

1. Proper implementation of the MERN Stack components
2. Application of software engineering principles
3. Functionality of the to-do list application
4. Clarity and organization of the report

*Note: Remember to provide clear instructions in your repository's README file on how to set up and run your application locally.*

# Not for the faint of heart

## Hungry For More

Are you finding this project more straightforward than you expected? Great, that means you're ready for a bigger challenge! Here are some ways you can take this project to the next level:

### Enhance the Backend
1. **Implement User Authentication**: Use technologies like JWT (JSON Web Token) or Passport.js to allow users to sign up, log in, and manage their own unique to-do lists. 
2. **Advanced Database Interactions**: Enhance your MongoDB interactions by implementing more complex queries or aggregations. Create dynamic queries based on user inputs.
3. **API Versioning**: Implement API versioning in your application to make your backend more robust and scalable. This will help in managing future changes to your API.

### Enhance the Frontend
4. **Implement State Management**: If you haven't done so already, consider integrating a state management library like Redux. This will make managing your application state easier as it scales.
5. **User Interface (UI) Improvements**: Improve your application's UI by incorporating a UI framework like Material-UI or Bootstrap. Also consider adding loading spinners, error messages, and form validations.
6. **Unit Testing**: Use a testing library, such as Jest, to write unit tests for your React components. This will ensure your frontend is working as expected and make your application more maintainable.

### DevOps
7. **Dockerize your Application**: Dockerize your MERN Stack application to ensure it can be run in any environment without any compatibility issues.
8. **Deploy your Application**: Deploy your application to a cloud platform like Heroku or AWS. This will allow you to share your application with others and gain experience in deployment and continuous integration.

### Documentation
9. **Improve your Documentation**: Write detailed documentation explaining how each part of your application works. This could include code comments, a comprehensive README, API documentation, or even a video walkthrough.

### Follow Best Practices
10. **Code Linting**: Implement code linting to make sure your code adheres to best practices. Tools like ESLint can help you with this.
11. **Security**: Implement security best practices in your application. This might include securing your endpoints, sanitizing user inputs, and handling errors properly.

Remember, the goal is not just to complete the task but to learn and challenge yourself. Good luck!
