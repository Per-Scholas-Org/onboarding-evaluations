**Email: Whoever is teaching**

## General Information
**Description:**
This advanced course is a six (6) week comprehensive and intensive training in advanced software engineering, delivered via asynchronous videos. The course is divided into modules where learners familiarize themselves with teaching principles and the practical application of software engineering in various languages and technologies. Each curriculum module is project-based, developing key instructor skills through interactive videos.

Our primary goal is to revolutionize how software engineering is instructed, ensuring our course instructors are job-ready with the most up-to-date, prevalent, and transferable skills/tech stack.

## Course Modules

**Module 1: Teaching MERN Basics**
Learners will familiarize themselves with the components of the MERN Stack and develop a simple application that allows users to add, view, and delete items from a to-do list.

**Module 2: Teaching MongoDB**
Learners gain hands-on experience in MongoDB, data modeling, CRUD operations, querying documents, indexing, and Mongoose. 

**Module 3: Teaching Node.js with Real-time Features**
Learners develop a web application using Node.js, implementing a simple authentication system and a real-time chat feature using Socket.io.

**Module 4: Teaching Web Applications with Express.js**
Learners build a web application using Express.js, integrating MongoDB databases, implementing user authentication and authorization, and using template engines for rendering dynamic content.

**Module 5: Teaching React with the MERN Stack**
Learners demonstrate their understanding of React by creating a dynamic, user-friendly web application, integrating their React frontend with a backend API.

**Module 6: Teaching Interview Preparation Workshop and Problem-Solving Exercise**
Learners prepare a workshop for learners, focusing on algorithms, data structures, systems design, and problem-solving techniques.

## Technical Grading and Graduation Requirements

- **Each Module Project - 70%**
Each module has a project assignment.

- **Instructor Quality - 30%**
Learners will also be evaluated on their ability to instruct and present complex information understandably.

## Attendance and Plagiarism Policy

The course is asynchronous so no attendance is mandatory. We have a strict no plagiarism policy. Plagiarism is considered cheating. Any learners caught plagiarizing will be automatically dismissed.

Only those learners who have maintained a GPA of 80% or higher and have met all of the requirements will receive a Certificate of completion.
