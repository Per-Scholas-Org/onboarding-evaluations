# Module 1: Introduction to Teach the MERN Stack and Software Engineering

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the components of the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)
- Recognize the advantages of using the MERN Stack for web application development
- Learn about various software engineering principles and their importance in application development
- Gain insight into different software development methodologies
- Differentiate between front-end and back-end development
- Compare the Model-View-Controller (MVC) and Model-View-Presenter (MVP) design patterns

## Skill-Based Assessment

### Assignment: Create a Simple MERN Stack Application

**Objective:** Demonstrate your understanding of the MERN Stack components, software engineering principles, and basic front-end and back-end development concepts.

**Instructions:**

1. Set up a new MERN Stack project with MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js.
2. Create a simple application that allows users to add, view, and delete items from a to-do list.
3. Apply software engineering principles to ensure your code is maintainable, reusable, testable, flexible, and efficient.
4. Implement front-end features using React.js, and handle back-end logic with Express.js and Node.js.
5. Connect your application to a MongoDB database to store and retrieve the to-do list data.
6. Write a brief report (1-2 pages) outlining your approach to the application development, the software engineering principles applied, and any challenges you faced during the process.

### Submission

- Commit your source code and the brief report (as a PDF or Markdown file) to a GitHub repository.
- Submit the GitHub repository link via Canvas.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

1. Proper implementation of the MERN Stack components
2. Application of software engineering principles
3. Functionality of the to-do list application
4. Clarity and organization of the report

*Note: Remember to provide clear instructions in your repository's README file on how to set up and run your application locally.*

# Module 2: Teaching MongoDB

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the key features and benefits of MongoDB as a NoSQL database
- Learn how to design data models for MongoDB, including collections, documents, and normalization/denormalization
- Perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using MongoDB
- Query documents using MongoDB's query operators and aggregation framework
- Implement indexing for improved query performance
- Use Mongoose to connect applications to MongoDB, define schemas, and perform validations

## Skill-Based Assessment

### Assignment: Create a MongoDB Database for a Blog

**Objective:** Demonstrate your understanding of MongoDB, data modeling, CRUD operations, querying documents, indexing, and Mongoose.

**Instructions:**

1. Design a data model for a blog that includes collections for users, posts, and comments.
2. Set up a MongoDB database locally or using a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas.
3. Use Mongoose to define schemas for the users, posts, and comments collections, ensuring that appropriate validation is applied.
4. Implement CRUD operations for users, posts, and comments using Mongoose.
5. Create sample queries to demonstrate various query operators and the aggregation framework.
6. Implement indexing for appropriate fields in your collections.
7. Write a brief report (1-2 pages) outlining your approach to designing the data model, implementing CRUD operations, querying documents, indexing, and using Mongoose.

### Submission

- Commit your source code, Mongoose schemas, sample queries, and the brief report (as a PDF or Markdown file) to a GitHub repository.
- Submit the GitHub repository link via Canvas.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

1. Proper data model design for the blog
2. Correct use of Mongoose for schema definition, validation, and CRUD operations
3. Variety and correctness of sample queries
4. Appropriate indexing of fields in collections
5. Clarity and organization of the report

*Note: Remember to provide clear instructions in your repository's README file on how to set up your application, and provide seed data*
