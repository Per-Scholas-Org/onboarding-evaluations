# Module 6: Algorithms, Data Structures, and Systems Design

## Learning Objectives

- Understand key concepts in algorithms, data structures, and systems design
- Learn problem-solving techniques for algorithm and data structure problems
- Gain insights into systems design principles and real-world applications
- Prepare for technical interviews by practicing algorithm, data structure, and systems design questions

## Skill-Based Assessment

### Assignment: Interview Preparation Workshop and Problem-Solving Exercise

**Objective:** Demonstrate your understanding of algorithms, data structures, and systems design by preparing a workshop for learners that covers interview preparation and real-world applications of these concepts.

**Instructions:**

1. Design a workshop that covers:
   - Algorithm and data structure problem-solving techniques
   - Tips and best practices for interview preparation
   - Systems design principles and real-world applications
2. Create a slide deck or other visual aids to support your workshop content.
3. Develop a set of algorithm and data structure problems, along with their solutions, for learners to practice during the workshop. Include a variety of problem types and difficulty levels.
4. Prepare a systems design exercise that allows learners to apply the principles and concepts they've learned in a real-world scenario. Provide a clear problem statement, requirements, and guidelines for the exercise.
5. Write a brief report (1-2 pages) outlining your approach to creating the workshop, the learning objectives, and how the workshop content will help learners succeed in interviews and their careers.

### Submission

- Build your workshop materials (slide deck, problem set, systems design exercise, and report) in Google Slides, Keynote or PowerPoint.
- Submit zip file via Canvas with all slide deck.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

1. Comprehensive coverage of algorithms, data structures, and systems design concepts in the workshop
2. Quality and clarity of the slide deck or visual aids
3. Variety and relevance of the algorithm and data structure problems
4. Applicability of the systems design exercise to real-world scenarios
5. Effectiveness of the workshop in preparing learners for interviews and real-world applications
6. Clarity and organization of the report

*Note: Remember to provide clear instructions in your repository's README file on how to access and use your workshop materials.*
