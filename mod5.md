# Module 5: Teaching React with MERN

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the key features and benefits of the React library
- Learn about the React component model and its building blocks
- Gain knowledge of creating and managing components using JSX
- Familiarize with React developer tools for debugging and optimization
- Utilize popular React libraries and frameworks such as Redux, React Router, and UI component libraries

## Skill-Based Assessment

### Assignment: Build a React Web Application with the MERN Stack

**Objective:** Demonstrate your understanding of React, its component model, JSX, and popular React libraries and frameworks. Create a dynamic, user-friendly web application using the MERN stack.

**Instructions:**

1. Set up a Node.js project with a package.json file and necessary dependencies, including React and other libraries you'll use (e.g., Redux, React Router).
2. Develop a web application using React with a component-based architecture, creating and managing components using JSX.
3. Integrate your React frontend with a backend API built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.
4. Implement client-side routing using React Router and state management using Redux (or a suitable alternative).
5. Incorporate a UI component library such as Material-UI or Ant Design for a polished, professional look.
6. Test your application using React Developer Tools, and optimize its performance and usability.
7. Write a brief report (1-2 pages) outlining your approach to building the web application, implementing React features and libraries, and any challenges you faced during the process.

### Submission

- Commit your source code and the brief report (as a PDF or Markdown file) to a GitHub repository.
- Submit the GitHub repository link via Canvas.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

1. Proper implementation of React and its component model
2. Effective use of JSX for creating and managing components
3. Integration of the React frontend with a backend API
4. Implementation of client-side routing and state management
5. Incorporation of a UI component library for a polished look
6. Successful testing and optimization using React Developer Tools
7. Clarity and organization of the report

*Note: Remember to provide clear instructions in your repository's README file on how to set up and run your application locally.*
