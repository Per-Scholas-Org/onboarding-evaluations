# Module 3: Teaching Node.js

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the key features and benefits of Node.js as a JavaScript runtime environment
- Gain knowledge of Node.js core modules and their functionalities
- Learn how to use NPM (Node Package Manager) for package and dependency management
- Build web applications using Node.js built-in modules, such as HTTP
- Implement real-time communication in web applications using Socket.io

## Skill-Based Assessment

### Assignment: Build a Node.js Web Application with Real-time Features

**Objective:** Demonstrate your understanding of Node.js, its core modules, and APIs for building web and networked applications. Implement real-time communication using Socket.io.

**Instructions:**

1. Set up a Node.js project with a package.json file and necessary dependencies.
2. Create a web application using Node.js built-in HTTP module, handling routing and serving static files.
3. Implement a simple authentication system without using any external library or database (e.g., use an in-memory store for registered users).
4. Develop a real-time chat feature using Socket.io to allow authenticated users to communicate with each other.
5. Write a brief report (1-2 pages) outlining your approach to building the web application, implementing real-time features, and any challenges you faced during the process.

### Submission

- Commit your source code and the brief report (as a PDF or Markdown file) to a GitHub repository.
- Submit the GitHub repository link via Canvas.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

1. Proper implementation of Node.js and its core modules
2. Functionality of the web application, including routing and serving static files
3. Correct implementation of a simple authentication system
4. Functionality of the real-time chat feature using Socket.io
5. Clarity and organization of the report

*Note: Remember to provide clear instructions in your repository's README file on how to set up and run your application locally.*
