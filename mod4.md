# Module 4: Teaching Express

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the key features and benefits of the Express.js framework
- Learn how to use Express.js in tandem with Node.js for server-side development
- Gain knowledge of Express middleware and its use cases
- Implement routing and serving static files with Express.js
- Understand how to use template engines for rendering dynamic content in web applications
- Learn and apply best practices for designing and deploying MERN stack web applications

## Skill-Based Assessment

### Assignment: Build a Web Application with Express.js

**Objective:** Demonstrate your understanding of the Express framework, its key features, and best practices for designing and deploying a web application using the MERN stack.

**Instructions:**

1. Set up a Node.js project with a package.json file and necessary dependencies, including Express.js.
2. Create a web application using the Express.js framework, implementing routing and serving static files.
3. Integrate a MongoDB database using Mongoose to store user information and other application data.
4. Implement user authentication and authorization using Passport.js or another suitable authentication library.
5. Use a template engine like EJS, Pug, or Handlebars to render dynamic content in your web application.(In class we use the JSX View Engine, look it up on NPM)
6. Follow best practices for MERN stack web applications, such as modularizing your code, using environment variables, securing API endpoints, implementing error handling, and optimizing performance.
7. Write a brief report (1-2 pages) outlining your approach to building the web application, implementing Express.js features, and adhering to best practices for MERN stack applications.

### Submission

- Commit your source code and the brief report (as a PDF or Markdown file) to a GitHub repository.
- Submit the GitHub repository link via Canvas.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

1. Proper implementation of Express.js framework and its features
2. Functionality of the web application, including routing and serving static files
3. Integration of MongoDB with Mongoose
4. Correct implementation of user authentication and authorization
5. Effective use of a template engine for rendering dynamic content
6. Adherence to best practices for MERN stack web applications
7. Clarity and organization of the report

*Note: Remember to provide clear instructions in your repository's README file on how to set up and run your application locally.*
